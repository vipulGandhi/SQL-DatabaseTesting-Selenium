// Database Concepts

// Database Testing 
	// Validating whether the data displaying on the UI is matching the data that is stored in the database
	// Examples:
		// Adding a new user from UI should add a new record with the same user details under the respective table in DB
		// Updating a new user from UI should update the details stored in DB

// Database
	// Collection of related data

// Database Management System (DBMS)
	// Software that stores data in databases in an organized way to make it easier to create, retrieve, update, delete the data 
	// Examples:  MySQL, Oracle, MongoDB, MariaDB, SQLite, Cassandra etc.

// Data Models
	// Define how data is connected to each other and stored inside the system
	// Types of Data Models
		// Hierarchical Model
		// Network Model
		// Entity-Relationship Model
		// Relational Model

// Relational Model
	// Is popular and widely used by most of the DBMS
	// DBMS using Relational Data Models are known as RDBMS
	// Data is stored in the form of tables (Columns and Rows)

// SQL - Structured Query Language
	// Programming language for Relational Databases
	// SQL is for Relational Databases only and it comes as a default feature in the RDBMS software (Oracle, MySQL etc)

// JDBC
	// JDBC is a Java API to connect and execute the SQL query with the database
	// Responsible for the connectivity between the Java Programming language and the databases
	// The JDBC API provides the following classes and interfaces
    	// Driver Manager
    	// Driver
    	// Connection
    	// Statement
    	// ResultSet
    	// SQLException
